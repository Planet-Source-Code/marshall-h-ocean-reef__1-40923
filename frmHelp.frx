ÿOcean Reef Help
----------------------------------------
To play Ocean Reef, click on the Game 
menu and then on New Game. The game 
will start and you will see a diver at the left 
of the screen. Use the ARROW KEYS to 
move him around. Avoid hitting the fishes, 
because it means you'll knocked almost 
unconcious. Keep and eye on your Health 
meter at the bottom of your screen. If 
your health is running low, pick up a First 
Aid kit. To win the game, find the hidden 
key in each level and swim to the treasure 
chest at the end of the level, avoiding the 
shark. If the shark is sleeping, you must 
have forgot the key. You must have the 
key to open the chest and go to the next 
level. On level 3 you be able to get a pair of 
flippers, which will help you swim faster.
